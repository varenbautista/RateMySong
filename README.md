# My Personal Project: Rate My Song

## What Will the Application Do?
For my final project of CPSC 210 Software Construction, I will be making a **Song Rating Application**
based on the songs inputted by the user. Users will be able to input songs, rate the lyricism, production,
and vocals on a scale of 1 to 5, and add notes as to what they did and did not like about the song. 
The user will then be able to view their list of songs from most liked to least liked based on each song's
overall score.

## Who Will Use It?
This application is targetted towards users want to take their music listening a step deeper. It's one thing
to listen to a song and simply "like it." Dissecting a song's lyrics, sound degisn, and vocal performance
is a completely different process. This application will allow users to record their thoughts about certain
songs, appreciate music more, and keep them in a well organized list.

## Why is this Project of Interest to Me?
This application intrigued me because of my particular love for music. I believe music is one of the 
most diverse and creative expressions of emotions. This application will encourage users to dig deeper
than what is presented in a three minute expression of the artist's character.
